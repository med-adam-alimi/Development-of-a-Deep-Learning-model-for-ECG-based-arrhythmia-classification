## 🧠 Overview

I am currently focusing on AI and deep learning applications, especially in healthcare. This project uses deep learning techniques to classify ECG data and demonstrates how machine learning can assist in medical diagnosis. It also explores the deployment of AI models on web and mobile platforms using Flutter and Firebase.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The ECG data used for training and evaluation was sourced from a publicly available dataset on **Kaggle**.

---

## 🏗️ Model

The deep learning model combines:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction from ECG signals
- **Transformer-based layers** for learning temporal and sequential patterns

---

## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy:** 0.97
- **F1 Score:** 0.94

The model achieved high performance in distinguishing between different types of arrhythmias using single-lead ECG data.
