# 🫀 ECG-Based Arrhythmia Classification with Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing a **deep learning model** for classifying cardiac arrhythmias from ECG (electrocardiogram) signals.  
It combines **CNNs, Transformer encoders, and Wavelet transforms** to capture both spatial and temporal features of ECG signals.  
Goal: Support early detection of arrhythmias and assist doctors in decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset (109,000+ samples)  
- **Classes**: 5 arrhythmia types  
- **Preprocessing**: Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), normalization, data augmentation, SMOTE  

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
- **Dual-branch architecture**:  
  - CNN layers → feature extraction  
  - Transformer encoders → sequential/temporal patterns  
- **Optimization**: Mixed precision training (AMP), early stopping, cross-validation
  
---

## 📈 Results
- **Accuracy**: 99.26%  
- **F1-score**: 90.25%  
- **Minority Class Recall**: +20% (via SMOTE + augmentation)  

📉 Performance visualization:  
- Confusion matrix  
- ROC curves
